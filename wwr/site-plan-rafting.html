    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my white water rafting website! The purpose for this website is to show the many wonderful aspects of white water rafting.
      I will highlight some of the best white water rafting sites in Costa Rica! I will also highlight some of the safety measure, places to stay, and pricing 
      of these one of a kind adventures! I want to bring families together while experiencing the wonders of Costa Rica. 
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My key audience is those that are traveling to Costa Rica. Costa Rica is one of the premier white water rafting locations
      in the entire world! Generally more tourists come from either The United States or Canada. 
      Because of this fact, they will be my main focus with respect to the nationality of customers. I will also try to reach more people within
      the age range between 13 to 35 years old. I will be focusing more on families too. Remembering these factors I want to include more pictures 
      of happy families rafting. I also want to have some lighter colors that are more family friendly, rather than darker colors.
        </p>
